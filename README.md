- If you go to this [link](https://sunnypranay.github.io/vcard/). My contact information will be automatically downloaded.
- I will link this [URL](https://sunnypranay.github.io/vcard/) to QR and print the QR on my business card.

## Feature Work

- Automatic download thing is not working in Google chrome ipadOs. It's working perfectly fine in safari ipadOs. That thing needed to be addressed. If anyone have any any idea how to solve it that would be great. You can contribute your approach.
