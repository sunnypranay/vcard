# 📇 Generation of VCF Card Using JavaScript 🖥

The VCF, or vCard, is a "Virtual Contact File," a standard format used for storing and sharing personal contact information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and more. Consider it as a digital business card. This project enables the generation of these vCards, streamlining the process of sharing contact information.

🍏 Before Apple introduced "NameDrop" for iPhone users to easily share contact info, and for Android users who don't have an equivalent feature, this project provides a universal solution. 🌍

## Key Features:
- **📞 VCF Generation**: Create vCards to make sharing contact information seamless.
- **📁 Data Storage**: Uses a `data.json` file to store the contact information you wish to share.
- **🔗 QR Code Integration**: Linking to this [URL](https://sunnypranay.github.io/vcard/) via a QR code on a business card enables quick access. Scanning the QR code automatically triggers a download of the contact information to the user's device.
- **🌐 Universal Compatibility**: Unlike platform-specific solutions like NameDrop on iPhone, this tool works on both Android and iOS platforms.

## 🚧 Upcoming Features:
- Addressing automatic download issues on Google Chrome for iPadOS (works perfectly in Safari for iPadOS). 💡 Contributions and solutions to this problem are welcomed.

📌 _Note: If you've used "NameDrop" on the iPhone, think of this as a cross-platform alternative that doesn't require both users to be physically near each other._ 📲🔄
